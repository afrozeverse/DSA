# Data Structures & Algorithms (Pattern-Based)

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice using a pattern-based approach** rather than traditional topic-wise learning.

Instead of solving problems randomly, I focus on identifying **core problem-solving patterns** and applying them across multiple questions.  
This helps in building **strong intuition, logical thinking, and optimization skills**, which are essential for interviews and competitive programming.

## 🚀 Why Pattern-Based Learning?

Most DSA problems are variations of a **limited set of patterns**.  
Learning patterns helps to:
- Recognize problems faster
- Avoid brute-force thinking
- Write optimized solutions confidently
- Reduce problem-solving time in interviews

## 🧠 Patterns Covered (Growing)

- Sliding Window  
- Two Pointers  
- Binary Search  
- Prefix Sum  
- Hashing  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Greedy  
- Stack & Queue Patterns  
- Tree & Graph Patterns (later)

Each pattern has its **own folder** with problems and a dedicated README.
